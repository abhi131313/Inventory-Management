# Inventory Management Application

This is a simple inventory management application built with React and Redux. It allows users to view, edit, and manage product inventory, with different permissions for admin and regular users.

## Features

- **View Inventory:** Display a list of products with details like name, category, price, quantity, and status (disabled/enabled).
- **Edit Products:** Modify product details (name, category, price, quantity) through a dedicated form.
- **Disable/Enable Products:** Toggle the availability of products.
- **Delete Products:** Remove products from the inventory.
- **Admin/User Mode:** Different permissions for admin and regular users. Admins can perform all actions, while users have limited access.
- **Real-time Statistics:** Display key statistics about the inventory, such as total products, total store value, out-of-stock items, and number of categories.
- **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.
